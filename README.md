# Bangla-Stopwords

Stop word lists of different languages have been developed already around the world. The Bengali language is a grammatically enriched language. It has a large vocabulary containing a massive number of stop words. There is no proper set of stop words for the Bengali language. A proper set of stop word list is highly required in modern information retrieval systems. In this project, a corpus-based methodology for detection and extraction of Bengali stop word is proposed. We have used machine learning library NLTK from python environment.
